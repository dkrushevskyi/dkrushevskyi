Hello, I'm Dmytro Krushevskyi (@dkrushevskyi), and I'd like to share a bit more about myself:

👨‍💻 I've been immersed in the exciting world of the IT industry since 2014, working on commercial projects. Programming is my passion, and I'm always eager to tackle intriguing and complex challenges. I started working immediately after graduating in Computer Science, and this journey has been an incredible learning experience.

📚 Besides work, I make time for reading books because I believe that learning from others is the best way to expand one's mindset.

🎵 I'm also drawn to the world of music. I engage in music production, which is a fantastic outlet for my creativity and emotions.

👨‍👦 Most importantly, I prioritize spending time with my son. It's incredibly important to me, and I always strive to make those moments special.

I'm always open to new connections and collaborations, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn to share your ideas and projects. Let's stay in touch! 😊🚀
